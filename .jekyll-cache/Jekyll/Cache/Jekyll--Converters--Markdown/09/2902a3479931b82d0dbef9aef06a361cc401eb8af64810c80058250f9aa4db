  <li>Shoulder pain that persists more than a few days?</li>

<p>The worst part about injuring your shoulder is that it limits many of your daily routine tasks which require the motion of your shoulder to successfully achieve such as, carrying something, picking something up, reaching for an object or doing any upper body exercise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shoulder pain can be caused by several different events or conditions such as rotator cuff tears, strains, frozen shoulder, bursitis, general wear and tear due to aging, bruising, and many more. This is why an accurate diagnosis is critical to successful treatment.</p>

<p>Here at (Insert Pratice Name) we take a holistic approach to treating shoulder conditions. We focus on the entire neuromusculoskeletal system, rather than simply the injury site. This includes the spine as a whole, extremity joints (elbow, wrist etc), muscles, ligaments, tendons, as well as the nervous system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first step in helping you manage and prevent your problem is to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. We achieve this through a comprehensive clinical history, thorough physical examination including; neurological, orthopedic, and musculoskeletal tests, and possibly further diagnostic investigations such as X-Rays (if required).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once our team has all the information required to make an accurate diagnosis, we will explain our findings to you in a simple and concise manner. Based on the information we collect, we can then tailor a treatment plan specific to your condition and goals. Our team is dedicated to helping you manage and prevent shoulder injuries in a holistic manner, so you can get back to doing what you love. If at any stage we determine that you need to be referred out to another provider we will be sure to find the right people for you.</p>
