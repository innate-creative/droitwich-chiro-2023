<p>There are many possible types of headaches and migraines, which is why it is important for your chiropractor to establish an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tension headaches are very common in people who spend a lot of time sitting, especially those who work in front of computers. The pain often starts in the neck or base of the skull and travels around to the front of the head. This type of headache can present as a dull ache.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The symptoms of migraine on the other hand are often more intense. Many migraine sufferers will experience a severe headache and may have accompanying visual disturbances, sensitivity to light and sound, and in some instances nausea. Many people who experience migraine headaches regularly report they can feel the headache coming on.</p>

<p>Due to the close relationship between the nerves of the cervical spine and the head, many headaches can originate from dysfunction in the cervical spine (cervicogenic headache).</p>

<h3 id="common-causes-of-headaches-and-migraine">Common causes of headaches and migraine:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Poor posture (head forward of shoulders)</li>
  <li>Prolonged sitting positions</li>
  <li>Dehydration</li>

  <li>Stress</li>
  <li>Dietary triggers (dark chocolate, red wine)</li>
