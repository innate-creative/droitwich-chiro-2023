<p>The intervertebral discs are the shock absorbers of the spine, they sit in between vertebrae and help to distribute forces throughout the body, as well as aid in the movement of the spine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disc injuries are when the intervertebral discs become damaged through either physical trauma or general wear and tear.Â Â </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Terms such as a bulged disc, ruptured disc, or herniated disc are common terms used to describe when the outer portion of the disc is torn. A tare in the disc can result in the contents of the disc â€˜bulgingâ€™ out and compressing spinal nerves, resulting in local and referred nerve pain.Â </p>

<p>Sciatica is a common example of how a disc in the lumbar spine can be damaged and impinge a nerve causing referred pain down the leg.</p>

<h2 id="treating-disc-injuries">Treating disc injuries:</h2>

<p>Here at (Insert Practice Name) we take a holistic approach to treating conditions of the spine, including disc injuries. We focus on the entire neuromusculoskeletal system, rather than simply the injury site. This includes the spine as a whole, extremity joints (hip, knee, etc), muscles,Â  ligaments, tendons, as well as the nervous system. The first step in helping you manage and prevent your problem is to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. We achieve this through a comprehensive clinical history, thorough physical examination including; neurological, orthopaedic, and musculoskeletal tests, and possibly further diagnostic investigations such as X-Rays (if required).Â </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once our team has all the information required to make an accurate diagnosis, we will explain our findings to you in a simple and concise manner. Based on the information we collect, we will then tailor a treatment plan specific to your condition and goals.</p>
