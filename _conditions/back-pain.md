## **Understanding Back Pain**

Back pain is a prevalent issue that can significantly disrupt your daily life, making simple tasks such as walking, sitting, or lifting objects challenging and uncomfortable. Several factors can contribute to back pain, including:

1. **Muscle Strain:** Overexertion or improper use of back muscles can lead to strain and discomfort.
2. **Spinal Misalignment:** Misalignments in the spine can cause pain and affect overall body function.
3. **Herniated Discs:** Discs between vertebrae can bulge or rupture, putting pressure on nerves and causing pain.
4. **Sciatica:** Compression of the sciatic nerve can result in sharp pain radiating from the lower back down to the legs.
5. **Arthritis:** Inflammatory joint conditions can cause chronic back pain.
