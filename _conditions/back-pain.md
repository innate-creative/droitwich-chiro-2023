>For anyone who has suffered from this condition, you are aware of how debilitating it can be. Back pain and sciatica can significantly impact your daily life, hampering many everyday activities.

## Treating Back Pain and Sciatica:
Here at (Insert Practice Name) we take a holistic approach to treating conditions of the spine. We focus on the entire neuromusculoskeletal system, rather than simply the injury site. This includes the spine as a whole, extremity joints (hip, knee, etc), muscles, ligaments, tendons, as well as the nervous system.

>The first step in helping you manage and prevent your problem is to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. We achieve this through a comprehensive clinical history, thorough physical examination including; neurological, orthopaedic, and musculoskeletal tests, and possibly further diagnostic investigations such as X-Rays (if required).

Once our team has all the information required to make an accurate diagnosis, we will explain our findings to you in a simple and concise manner. Based on the information we collect, we will then tailor a treatment plan specific to your condition and goals. Our team is dedicated to helping you manage and prevent back pain and sciatica in a holistic manner. If at any stage we determine that you need to be referred out to another provider we will be sure to find the right people for you.

### Prevention and Education:
In order to help you experience results outside of our practice, our team will equip you with knowledge on how to prevent future injuries, give you sound ergonomic advice, as well as prescribe specific rehabilitation exercises just for you.
