      The intervertebral discs are the shock absorbers of the spine, they sit in
      between vertebrae and help to distribute forces throughout the body, as
      well as aid in the movement of the spine. Disc injuries are when the
      intervertebral discs become damaged through either physical trauma or
      general wear and tear.

## Introduction

Welcome to Droitwich Back and Neck Clinic, where we offer specialized chiropractic care to help individuals find relief from disc injuries.

However, with the expert care provided by Dr. Andrew Robson, our experienced chiropractor, there is hope for a pain-free and active future.

## Understanding Disc Injuries

Disc injuries, specifically in the spine, are common and can cause excruciating pain and discomfort. The intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae, absorbing shock and enabling flexibility in the spine. However, due to various factors such as aging, repetitive stress, poor posture, or traumatic incidents, these discs can become damaged, leading to conditions like herniated discs or bulging discs.

## The Role of Chiropractic Care

Chiropractic care, a non-invasive and drug-free approach, has shown remarkable results in alleviating pain and restoring functionality for individuals with disc injuries. Dr. Andrew's expertise in chiropractic techniques ensures that patients receive personalized care and attention tailored to their specific needs.

## **Chiropractic Treatments for Disc Injuries**

### 1\. Spinal Adjustments

Spinal adjustments, also known as spinal manipulation, are a core aspect of chiropractic care. Dr. Andrew uses gentle yet effective adjustments to realign the spine, taking pressure off the injured discs and surrounding nerves. Numerous studies have supported the efficacy of spinal adjustments in reducing pain and improving mobility in patients with disc injuries \[^1^\].

### 2\. Flexion-Distraction Technique

The flexion-distraction technique is a specialized chiropractic method used to treat disc herniations and other disc-related issues. This gentle, non-thrusting approach involves a pumping motion that decompresses the affected discs, promoting healing and reducing symptoms. Research has demonstrated that flexion-distraction treatment can be highly beneficial for patients with herniated discs \[^2^\].

### 3\. Therapeutic Exercises

Dr. Andrew believes in empowering his patients to take an active role in their recovery. He designs customized therapeutic exercise programs to strengthen the supporting muscles around the spine and improve flexibility. Studies have indicated that exercise-based chiropractic treatments can enhance outcomes for patients with disc injuries \[^3^\].
