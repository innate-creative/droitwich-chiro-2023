short_description: The intervertebral discs are the shock absorbers of the spine, they sit
      in between vertebrae and help to distribute forces throughout the body,
      as well as aid in the movement of the spine. Disc injuries are when the
      intervertebral discs become damaged through either physical trauma or
      general wear and tear.

The intervertebral discs are the shock absorbers of the spine, they sit in between vertebrae and help to distribute forces throughout the body, as well as aid in the movement of the spine.

>Disc injuries are when the intervertebral discs become damaged through either physical trauma or general wear and tear.  

Terms such as a bulged disc, ruptured disc, or herniated disc are common terms used to describe when the outer portion of the disc is torn. A tare in the disc can result in the contents of the disc ‘bulging’ out and compressing spinal nerves, resulting in local and referred nerve pain. 

Sciatica is a common example of how a disc in the lumbar spine can be damaged and impinge a nerve causing referred pain down the leg.

### What causes disc injuries?
- Whiplash injury (cervical spine),
- Incorrect lifting technique,
- Motor vehicle injuries,
- Repetitive microtrauma such as lifting, 
- Poor posture and poor ergonomics in the office,
- Age and obesity
- General wear and tear.

## Treating disc injuries:

Here at Droitwich Neck & Back Clinic we take a holistic approach to treating conditions of the spine, including disc injuries. We focus on the entire neuromusculoskeletal system, rather than simply the injury site. This includes the spine as a whole, extremity joints (hip, knee, etc), muscles,  ligaments, tendons, as well as the nervous system. The first step in helping you manage and prevent your problem is to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. We achieve this through a comprehensive clinical history, thorough physical examination including; neurological, orthopaedic, and musculoskeletal tests, and possibly further diagnostic investigations such as X-Rays (if required). 

>Once our team has all the information required to make an accurate diagnosis, we will explain our findings to you in a simple and concise manner. Based on the information we collect, we will then tailor a treatment plan specific to your condition and goals.

Our team is dedicated to helping you manage and prevent your condition in a holistic manner. If at any stage we determine that you need to be referred out to another provider we will be sure to find the right people for you. 

## Prevention and education:
In order to help you experience results outside of our practice, our team will equip you with knowledge on how to prevent future injuries, give you sound ergonomic advice, as well as prescribe specific rehabilitation exercises just for you.
