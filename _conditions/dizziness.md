## **Understanding Dizziness: A Common Yet Debilitating Issue**

Dizziness, characterized by a sensation of lightheadedness, spinning, or unsteadiness, is a common problem that can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. It may arise from various underlying causes, such as inner ear disorders, vestibular dysfunction, or misalignments in the spine.

Many individuals resort to medications that only provide temporary relief, failing to address the root cause of the issue. At Droitwich Back and Neck Clinic, we take a holistic approach to treating dizziness, aiming to uncover and rectify the underlying factors contributing to your discomfort.

Chiropractic care focuses on the relationship between the spine, nervous system, and overall body function. Dr. Andrew, our experienced chiropractor, employs gentle and precise adjustments to the spine to alleviate nerve interference and restore balance within the body. By addressing misalignments, known as subluxations, chiropractic care can have a profound impact on reducing dizziness and associated symptoms.
