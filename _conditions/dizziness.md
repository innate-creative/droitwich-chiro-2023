You may be wondering, why would I come to see a chiropractor if I am dizzy or experiencing vertigo?

Great question! Spinal alignment problems (especially those relating to the upper neck) may cause feelings of dizziness, this is termed cervicogenic dizziness. This is due to the close relationship between the structures and nerves of the cervical spine and the balance receptors in the brain. That being said there are many other possible causes of dizziness and vertigo. Some may be more serious than others. It is for this reason that an accurate diagnosis is critical. If we determine the cause of your dizziness is more serious in nature, we will be sure to refer you to the right healthcare providers.
