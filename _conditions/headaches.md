short_description: Pain medications are commonly used to deal with headaches, but
      unfortunately this approach only masks the symptoms rather than fix the
      underlying cause. Our focus is correcting the cause of your headaches,
      so you can experience lasting results and great health, all without the
      nasty side effects of long-term pain medication use.

## Are you suffering from headaches or migraines?

Here at Droitwich Back and Neck Clinic we understand how debilitating this can be, which is why we are dedicated to helping you recover naturally.

### Do you experience any of the following?
- Dull aching pain in your head?
- Tenderness in your neck, shoulders, and scalp?
- Tightness or pressure on your forehead or the side of your head?
- Throbbing sensation in your head?
- Visual disturbances?
- Sensitivity to light and noises?

There are many possible types of headaches and migraines, which is why it is important for your chiropractor to establish an accurate diagnosis.

>Tension headaches are very common in people who spend a lot of time sitting, especially those who work in front of computers. The pain often starts in the neck or base of the skull and travels around to the front of the head. This type of headache can present as a dull ache.

The symptoms of migraine on the other hand are often more intense. Many migraine sufferers will experience a severe headache and may have accompanying visual disturbances, sensitivity to light and sound, and in some instances nausea. Many people who experience migraine headaches regularly report they can feel the headache coming on.

Due to the close relationship between the nerves of the cervical spine and the head, many headaches can originate from dysfunction in the cervical spine (cervicogenic headache).

### Common causes of headaches and migraine:
- Poor posture (head forward of shoulders)
- Prolonged sitting positions
- Dehydration
- Trauma or accidents such as whiplash
- Stress
- Dietary triggers (dark chocolate, red wine)
- Dysfunction in the cervical spine
- Underlying disease or pathology (rare)
