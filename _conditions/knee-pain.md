## How chiropractic helps people with knee pain:

There are many factors that can cause knee pain.  Therefore, at Droitwich Back & Neck Clinic we carry out a thorough assessment that involves looking at movement and function in the feet, ankles, hips and low back as well as the knees in order to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis.  

From there we will create a personalised treatment plan. Chiropractic manipulation with accompanying exercises is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee and patellofemoral pain syndrome.
