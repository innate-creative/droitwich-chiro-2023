## How to ease migraines:
There can be many factors contributing to your migraines.  This is why at Droitwich Back & Neck Clinic we carry out a comprehensive case history and physical exam to get to provide an accurate diagnosis and get to ascertain the root cause or causes of the problem. Depending on the cause, chiropractic care, specifically spinal manipulation is an effective treatment for migraines. 

## How quickly do Migraines respond to treatment?
This is one of the most commonly asked questions, and the answer is that it’s completely unique to you.
It also depends a lot on the length of time you’ve suffered and on the principal causes. Once your chiropractor has completed the case history, initial exam and treatment he will be able to give you the best guideline of the timeframe for the results you desire.

Following a course of treatment patients experience a reduction in severity and frequency of migraines, leaving them feeling happier and able to work, rest and play like they deserve.
