## **Understanding Shoulder Pain**

Shoulder pain is a common issue that can significantly impact your daily activities, making simple tasks such as reaching for items, lifting, or even sleeping difficult and painful. There are various reasons why you might be experiencing shoulder pain, including:

1. **Muscle Strain:** Overuse or incorrect use of the shoulder muscles can lead to strain and discomfort.
2. **Joint Misalignment:** Misalignments in the shoulder joint can cause pain and restrict movement.
3. **Rotator Cuff Injuries:** The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint. Injuries to this area are a frequent source of shoulder pain.
4. **Arthritis:** Inflammatory joint conditions like arthritis can result in chronic shoulder pain.
5. **Nerve Compression:** Pinched nerves in the neck or upper back can cause referred pain in the shoulders.
