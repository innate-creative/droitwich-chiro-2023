## Do you need help with a shoulder problem?
Here at (Insert Pratice Name) we understand how debilitating shoulder pain can be, which is why we are dedicated to helping you recover naturally.

### Are you experiencing any of the following?:
- Shoulder pain that persists more than a few days?
- Inability to carry objects using the affected arm?
- Swelling or bruising? Shoulder pain that occurs at night?
- A limited, or painful range of motion of your shoulder?
- Difficulty sleeping on your side?
- Difficulty exercising or performing daily activities?

The worst part about injuring your shoulder is that it limits many of your daily routine tasks which require the motion of your shoulder to successfully achieve such as, carrying something, picking something up, reaching for an object or doing any upper body exercise.

>Shoulder pain can be caused by several different events or conditions such as rotator cuff tears, strains, frozen shoulder, bursitis, general wear and tear due to aging, bruising, and many more. This is why an accurate diagnosis is critical to successful treatment.

### Common causes of shoulder problems:
- Poor posture (in particular rounded shoulders)
- Prolonged sitting or inactivity
- Incorrect ergonomic set up,
- Repetitive movements above your head,
- Sporting injuries or physical trauma
- Overuse/repetitive strain injuries
- Poor sleeping positions
- Treating shoulder problems:

Here at (Insert Pratice Name) we take a holistic approach to treating shoulder conditions. We focus on the entire neuromusculoskeletal system, rather than simply the injury site. This includes the spine as a whole, extremity joints (elbow, wrist etc), muscles, ligaments, tendons, as well as the nervous system.

>The first step in helping you manage and prevent your problem is to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. We achieve this through a comprehensive clinical history, thorough physical examination including; neurological, orthopedic, and musculoskeletal tests, and possibly further diagnostic investigations such as X-Rays (if required).

Once our team has all the information required to make an accurate diagnosis, we will explain our findings to you in a simple and concise manner. Based on the information we collect, we can then tailor a treatment plan specific to your condition and goals. Our team is dedicated to helping you manage and prevent shoulder injuries in a holistic manner, so you can get back to doing what you love. If at any stage we determine that you need to be referred out to another provider we will be sure to find the right people for you.

### Prevention and education:

In order to help you experience lasting results outside of our practice, our team will equip you with knowledge on how to prevent future injuries, give you sound ergonomic advice, as well as prescribe specific rehabilitation exercises just for you.
