      Whatever your job is, the last thing you need is pain in your back and neck slowing you down, making it harder to work, and having a negative impact on your life outside work too. Repetitive physical work can lead to pain. We have seen many manual workers suffering from these issues, causing intense worry about potential inability to continue with work and loss of livelihood. We have helped many people like you get back to pain-free work and look forward to helping you too.

    heading: Seniors
    paragraph_html: >-
      Aging leads to loss of strength and flexibility. We also often find that small aches and pains can suddenly become big events in our lives. For some this can lead to a loss of independence or dignity. We understand how these issues affect your quality of life, and how physical pain can lead to a loss of leisure and social opportunities, and consequently a sense of isolation from friends and family, potentially leading to depression. We have helped large numbers of seniors get back to doing what they love, and look forward to doing the same for you.

    heading: Office Workers
    paragraph_html: >-
      Today, with more of the workforce working in an office-based environment than ever before, chronic problems associated with being desk-bound for many hours are becoming more and more prevalent. Even with the most ergonomic workstation set-up, more and more office workers are suffering from posture-related problems such as low and upper back pain, as well as chronic neck pain and headaches. We understand the misery that such pain can cause, making it hard to concentrate and perform at work, with the pain also crossing over to your personal life, making it harder to do the things you love. We look forward to helping you on your road to recovery.
