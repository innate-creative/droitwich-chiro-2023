## **The 3 Most Frequently Asked Chiropractic Care Questions and The Answers to Them**

Most people have a few questions when considering chiropractic care to naturally treat pain and injuries. If you've been wondering if chiropractic is a good option for you, you'll want to take a look at these commonly asked questions.

## **1. What Kinds of Conditions Do Chiropractors Treat?**

Chiropractic treatment focuses on your muscles, vertebrae, joints, tendons, and ligaments. The treatment may be a good choice if you experience joint, muscle or nerve pain after a car accident, fall or another type of injury.

Accidents aren't the only cause of pain. Fortunately, your chiropractor can also treat back, neck or shoulder pain related to poor posture, overuse injuries, tendonitis, bursitis, arthritis, and other conditions.

Pain and stiffness can occur when your spine becomes misaligned. Spinal misalignments cause your muscles and joints to become tight and stiff, and are responsible for pain and decreased range of motion. Misaligned vertebrae in your spine and tight muscles may also press on your nerves, triggering or increasing pain.

Chiropractic treatments are designed to improve the alignment of the spine, ease muscle tension and stiffness, relieve pressure on nerves, decrease inflammation, and improve range of motion and flexibility.

**Chiropractic treatment can helpful for many conditions, including:**

- Whiplash
- Headaches and Migraines
- Spinal Disc Issues
- Spinal Stenosis
- Osteoarthritis
- Pinched Nerves
- Dizziness
- Text Neck
- Leg Length Discrepancy
- Immune System Issues
- Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMJ)
- Tingling and Numbness in the Hands, Feet, Arms, and Legs
- Sciatica
- Scoliosis
- Pain in the Back, Neck, Head, Shoulders, Arms, Ribs, Hips, Legs, Feet and Pelvis
- Poor Posture
- Sprains and Strains
- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

## **2. What Treatments Do Chiropractors Offer?**

If you've ever seen a character on a TV show or movie receive chiropractic care, you may assume that spinal manipulations are the only treatments chiropractors offer. During spinal manipulation, your chiropractor uses quick, hands-on pressure to realign the small vertebrae in your spinal column. Many people refer to this as "cracking the neck," but the cracking sounds produced during manipulation are actually gas bubbles released from the joints.

### Spinal Manipulation
Improving the alignment of the spine with spinal manipulation reduces inflammation, improves flexibility and range of motion, enhances blood flow and decreases pressure on the joints, nerves, muscles, and ligaments.

>In 2017, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a systematic review of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of spinal manipulation in treating acute low back pain. The review noted that manipulation was associated with less pain and improved function six weeks after treatment.

Other studies have shown spinal manipulation and chiropractic treatments to be effective in treating whiplash, neck pain, plantar fasciitis, hip and knee osteoarthritis, migraines and other conditions.

### Flexion Distraction 
Flexion-Distraction is also a technique we utilise at Droitwich Back and Neck Clinic. It is a technique designed to take pressure and strain away from bulging, inflamed discs of the spine. Using a very gentle stretching technique, we are able to create space in between vertebral discs helping to reduce pain and improve quality of movement. This technique is particularly useful for patients with sciatica and bulging discs.

## **3. Am I a Good Candidate for Chiropractic Treatment?**

Chiropractic care is a safe, effective treatment option for most people. During your first visit, your chiropractor will perform a thorough examination, order X-rays or other diagnostic tests, and discuss your medical history and symptoms before recommending a treatment plan.

Although medication can temporarily dull your pain, your symptoms will return unless you address the cause. Chiropractic treatment treats the source of your pain, eliminating or reducing the need for pain killers or other medications. It's a good choice if you're experiencing sudden or chronic pain or have other symptoms, such as:

* Pain that affects any part of your body or shoots down your arms or legs
* Joint pain
* Muscle pain, weakness, tingling or numbness
* Difficulty walking, maintaining your balance, or sitting or standing without pain
* Frequent headaches, fatigue or difficulty concentrating due to your symptoms
* Chiropractic treatment can help relieve your symptoms naturally.
