> The first step in helping you manage and prevent your problem is to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis. We achieve this through a comprehensive clinical history, thorough physical examination including; neurological, orthopaedic, and musculoskeletal tests, and possibly further diagnostic investigations such as X-Rays (if required).

Once our team has all the information required to make an accurate diagnosis, we will explain our findings to you in a simple and concise manner. Based on the information we collect, we can then tailor a treatment plan specific to your condition and goals. Our team is dedicated to helping you manage and prevent shoulder injuries in a holistic manner, so you can get back to doing what you love. If at any stage we determine that you need to be referred out to another provider we will be sure to find the right people for you.
